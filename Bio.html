    I was born in Austin, TX to two Haitian parents. I completed my high school education at a charter school by the name of Harmony Science Academy, where I developed my passion for engineering. Upon graduation,
    I attended my local community college, Austin Community College. From there I completed two years of education before transferring to The University of Texas at Dallas, where I received my Bachelor's of Science
    in Biomedical Engineering.
