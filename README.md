# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For this project I decided to make a brief introduction to myself that includes
the homepage, my bio, hobbies, and skillset. The homepage is a brief introduction
and greetings that contains a nav bar that is replicated throughout the project.

The bio page is the most detailed page in terms of html properties as it contains
the different headers, paragraphs, a table, and an img.

The hobbies and skillset pages are pretty much the same in terms of html properties
as they are both unordered lists that contain the list items.

One of the things that I found most challenging was styling the nav-bar. I had
previously put the div tags for row and col inside the li thinking that is how
it would be nested to create a single row with four columns. Turns out that I
needed to nest the li tags inside the col tags to have the page become responsive
the way that I wanted it.
